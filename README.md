## Introduction

Diabetes is a rather common illness which affects millions of people worldwide. This illness is characterized by the inability of the body to keep the blood sugar concentration (glycemia) close to a nominal value of about 100 mg/dL. People affected by diabetes have to monitor their glycemia, keep a healthy lifestyle and, in some cases, have to take the appropriate medication. A low glycemia (below 70mg/dL) is associated to a number of symptoms and can lead, in rare cases, to a coma. A high glycemia (above 180 mg/dL) can also lead (rarely) to a coma and, in the long run, to the malfunction of various organs. These unwanted consequences can be avoided by a careful glycemic control.

A few years ago, continuous glucose sensors have appeared in the health market enabling people with diabetes to capture one glycemia every 5 or 15 minutes (contrary to 3-4 glycemia per day with the former technology). The amount of gathered data is precious to understand the glucose concentration variations to optimize the treatments and at the end of the day, people's health.

The purpose of this small project is to analyse the glycemia values extracted from continuous glucose sensors (here, 1 year of data) by creating simple comprehensive reports. The purpose of these reports is to facilitate the decision-making process for physicians and patients themselves.
